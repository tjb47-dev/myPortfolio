        {avatar: 'tb_logo.png', title:'Thomas Bailey', status:'Full Stack Web Developer', description:'My name is Thomas Bailey, I am a coding enthusiast and a student at the University of Central Florida coding bootcamp program. With a passion for technology and a natural curiosity for how things work, I have been fascinated with code since he was a child. I have always been committed to learning and exploring new technologies to develop my skills further. Currently I work for Publix and I am keen to apply my newfound skills in a role within my company. With a strong desire to develop the companys app for customers and work on the point-of-sale POS system, I am always looking for ways to use code to solve real-world problems. My passion for coding is not limited to work-related projects. I have combined my love for video games with my coding skills by modding various games, including GTA, and even started my own FiveM Gaming Server that runs .lua and .js. I do take great pride in the development process behind every project I work on and always seeking ways to improve my skill set.' }
