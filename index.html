            <h2>Hey there! Let me introduce myself.</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Thomas Bailey and Welcome to my portfolio page. I am currently a coding bootcamp student at the University of Central FL. I work for Publix and plan
                to take what I learn from this and apply for a position within Publix. I would love to develop our app for our customers and work on our POS system.
                I have been fascinated with how code works since I was a kid and I also love video games.
                I started to mix the two together by modding various game such as GTA. My passion grew stronger for coding when I started my own FiveM Gaming Server that
                runs .lua code. I love making new things work with code and the development process behind it.

            <p>
                I recently worked on my first website for our bootcamp course. I learned alot
                from this project. The Horiseon Website code needed to be refactored. Click the black GitHub Logo
                to follow the link to my github. You can also find my GitHub at the top right of this webpage. Optionally
                you can send me a email directly by clicking "Email Me"
